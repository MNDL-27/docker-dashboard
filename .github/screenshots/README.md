# Screenshots

This folder contains screenshots showcasing Docker Dashboard features.

## How to Add Screenshots

1. Take screenshots of your Docker Dashboard
2. Name them according to what they show:
   - `dashboard.png` - Main dashboard view
   - `container-details.png` - Container details page with charts
   - `cpu-breakdown.png` - CPU usage breakdown modal
   - `data-usage.png` - Data usage breakdown modal

3. Save them in this directory (`.github/screenshots/`)
4. They will automatically appear in the README

## Recommended Screenshot Specs

- **Format:** PNG (for better quality)
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080 or higher
- **Browser:** Full browser window (not just viewport)
- **Theme:** Dark mode (matches the dashboard design)

## Current Screenshots Needed

Based on the images you showed me:

1. ✅ `dashboard.png` - Main dashboard showing:
   - Container count (Running/Stopped/Total)
   - Global stats cards (CPU, RAM, Network, Data)
   - Container cards with status badges
   - "View Details" buttons

2. ✅ `container-details.png` - Individual container page showing:
   - Live CPU/RAM/Network/Disk charts
   - Real-time metrics
   - Time range selector (30 seconds, etc.)
   - Download/Upload bandwidth stats

3. ✅ `cpu-breakdown.png` - CPU modal showing:
   - CPU percentage per container
   - Sorted list from highest to lowest
   - Container IDs
   - Visual progress bars

4. ✅ `data-usage.png` - Data usage modal showing:
   - Total data per container
   - Download (green) and Upload (blue) amounts
   - Sorted by total usage

## Tips for Great Screenshots

- Close any personal information
- Show real data (makes it more impressive)
- Capture at peak usage (makes stats more interesting)
- Use full screen for maximum clarity
- Ensure text is readable
