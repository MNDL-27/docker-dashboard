# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## What Was Created

I've created a **beautiful, modern landing page** for your GitHub Pages site at:
- **URL**: https://mndl-27.github.io/docker-dashboard/
- **Location**: `/docs` folder in your repository

## Features of the New Site

✨ **Modern Design:**
- Animated gradient background
- Glass-morphism effects
- Responsive layout
- Beautiful typography

📸 **Complete Showcase:**
- All features listed with icons
- 4 screenshot sections with descriptions
- Quick start guide with code examples
- Links to GitHub, Wiki, Issues, Contributing

🎯 **Clear Messaging:**
- Explains this is a Docker app (not a live demo)
- Shows installation instructions
- Provides multiple resource links

## GitHub Pages Configuration Required

You need to configure GitHub Pages to serve from the `docs` folder:

### Steps:

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub:**
   ```
   https://github.com/MNDL-27/docker-dashboard
   ```

2. **Click on "Settings" tab** (top right)

3. **Scroll down to "Pages" section** (left sidebar under "Code and automation")

4. **Configure the source:**
   - **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Folder**: `/docs`
   - Click **Save**

5. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for GitHub to build and deploy

6. **Visit your site:**
   ```
   https://mndl-27.github.io/docker-dashboard/
   ```

## Current vs New Site

### Old Site (Before):
- ❌ Outdated design
- ❌ Missing features
- ❌ Unclear purpose
- ❌ No screenshots

### New Site (After):
- ✅ Modern animated design
- ✅ All features showcased
- ✅ Clear explanation (Docker app)
- ✅ Beautiful screenshot gallery
- ✅ Quick start guide
- ✅ Resource links

## Preview Locally (Optional)

To preview the site before it deploys:

```bash
cd docs
python -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Or on Windows with PowerShell:
```powershell
cd docs
python -m http.server 8000
```

## Troubleshooting

### Site not updating?
1. Check GitHub Pages settings (Settings → Pages)
2. Wait 2-3 minutes after pushing
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check Actions tab for build status

### Screenshots not loading?
The site uses screenshots from:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MNDL-27/docker-dashboard/main/.github/screenshots/
```

Make sure these files exist in your repository:
- `.github/screenshots/dashboard.png`
- `.github/screenshots/container-details.png`
- `.github/screenshots/cpu-breakdown.png`
- `.github/screenshots/data-usage.png`

### Want to customize?
Edit `docs/index.html` and push changes. GitHub Pages will automatically update.

## What This Site Does

🎯 **Purpose**: Marketing/landing page for your Docker Dashboard project

✅ **Shows:**
- What the app does
- How to install it
- Screenshots of features
- Links to documentation

❌ **Does NOT:**
- Run the actual dashboard (it's a Docker app!)
- Monitor containers (needs to be installed on a server)
- Provide live demos (requires Docker to run)

## Next Steps

1. Configure GitHub Pages (see steps above)
2. Wait for deployment (~2 minutes)
3. Visit https://mndl-27.github.io/docker-dashboard/
4. Share the link! 🎉

**Status**: ✅ Site created and pushed to GitHub
