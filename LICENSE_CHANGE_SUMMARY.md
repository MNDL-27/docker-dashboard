# 🔒 License Change Complete!

## Summary

Your Docker Dashboard has been successfully switched from **AGPL-3.0** to **Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause** - a restricted open source license.

---

## ✅ What Changed

### Old License (AGPL-3.0):
- Complex copyleft requirements
- Must open-source hosted modifications
- Unclear commercial restrictions
- Heavy compliance burden

### New License (Apache 2.0 + Commons Clause):
- **Simpler terms** - easier to understand
- **Clear commercial restriction** - cannot sell or monetize
- **More permissive** - can keep private modifications
- **Industry standard** - used by Redis, Neo4j, Confluent

---

## 🎯 What This Means

### ✅ Users Can Still:
- Use it **FREE** for personal projects
- Use it **FREE** internally in their company
- Use it **FREE** for education/learning
- Modify and customize the code
- Share it with others (with attribution)
- Keep their modifications private
- Contribute improvements back

### ❌ Users Cannot:
- **Sell it** as a product
- **Offer it as a hosted service** for money
- **Charge for access** to their instance
- Include it in **paid software bundles**
- Provide **consulting where it's the primary value**

## 🚀 Why This Is Better

### 1. **Clearer Protection**
- AGPL was designed for network services (confusing)
- Commons Clause explicitly says "you cannot sell this"
- No ambiguity for users or potential violators

### 2. **More User-Friendly**
- Companies can use it internally without worry
- No need to open-source every modification
- Less legal review required

### 3. **Industry Standard**
- Apache 2.0 is the most popular open-source license
- Commons Clause is used by major projects:
  - **Redis** (in-memory database)
  - **Neo4j** (graph database)
  - **Confluent** (Kafka distribution)
  - **Cockroach Labs** (distributed database)

### 4. **Better For You**
- Prevents companies from stealing your work
- Allows personal/business use freely
- Encourages contributions
- Protects your intellectual property

## 🔍 Key Restrictions

### The Commons Clause Prevents:

❌ **SaaS/Hosted Services**
```
Company CANNOT offer "Docker Dashboard Hosting" for $10/month
```

❌ **Selling Products**
```
Company CANNOT sell "Docker Dashboard Pro" for $99
```

❌ **Value-Based Consulting**
```
Consultant CANNOT charge if primary value is Docker Dashboard
BUT CAN charge for installation/configuration services
```

✅ **What's Still Allowed**
```
Company CAN use it on their internal servers for free
User CAN install it at home for personal use
School CAN use it for teaching Docker concepts
Developer CAN fork it and add features
```
