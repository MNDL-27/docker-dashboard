## Why This License?

This software is **free and open source**, but the Commons Clause ensures:

1. **Prevents Exploitation:** Large companies can't just take the software, rebrand it, and sell it
2. **Encourages Contribution:** If you want to commercialize, contribute back to the project
3. **Keeps It Free:** Ensures the software remains free for everyone
4. **Rewards Authors:** Protects the work of the original creators
