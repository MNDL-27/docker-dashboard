# Session Store Fix - MemoryStore Warning Resolution

## Problem
The application was showing this warning:
```
Warning: connect.session() MemoryStore is not
designed for a production environment, as it will leak
memory, and will not scale past a single process.
```

## Solution Implemented
Switched from the default in-memory session store to `session-file-store`, which persists sessions to the filesystem.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `package.json`
Added `session-file-store` dependency:
```json
"session-file-store": "^1.5.0"
```

### 2. Updated `server/index.js`
- Added `FileStore` import
- Configured session middleware to use file-based storage
- Sessions are now stored in `./sessions` directory
- Sessions expire after 24 hours
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions every hour

### 3. Updated `.gitignore`
Added `sessions/` directory to gitignore to prevent committing session files

## Manual Steps Required

Since you're using Docker with volume mounts, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Rebuild the container (to install new package)
```bash
cd ~/software/docker-dashboard
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Step 2: Verify the fix
```bash
docker compose logs
```

You should **no longer see** the MemoryStore warning. The logs should start cleanly with:
```
HTTP server listening on port 1714
```

## Benefits of File-Based Sessions

✅ **No Memory Leaks** - Sessions are stored on disk, not in RAM  
✅ **Persistence** - Sessions survive container restarts  
✅ **Production Ready** - Suitable for production use  
✅ **Automatic Cleanup** - Expired sessions are cleaned up every hour  
✅ **Scalable** - Can handle multiple processes (with shared filesystem)

## Session Storage Details

- **Location**: `./sessions` directory (inside container at `/app/sessions`)
- **TTL**: 24 hours
- **Cleanup Interval**: Every 60 minutes
- **Format**: JSON files (one per session)

## Alternative Options (Future Enhancement)

For even better scalability, consider:
- **Redis**: Best for distributed systems
- **MongoDB**: Good for complex session data
- **PostgreSQL**: If you already have a database

## Environment Variables

You can customize the session secret (recommended for production):
```yaml
environment:
  - SESSION_SECRET=your-strong-random-secret-here
```

## Rollback (if needed)

If you want to revert to the old behavior:
1. Remove `session-file-store` from `package.json`
2. Remove the `FileStore` import and configuration from `server/index.js`
3. Restore the simple session configuration
4. Rebuild the container
